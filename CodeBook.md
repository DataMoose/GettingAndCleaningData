__DATA COLLECTION DESCRIPTION__

Original dataset [1] may be downloaded at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Please refer to the README.txt within the zip file for details of the dataset. 

Briefly, experiments collected data from a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset was been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 



__DETAILS OF DATA TRANSFORMATIONS TO PRODUCE TIDY DATASET__

The 'run_analysis.R' code will import the original data set and perform a number of transformations to produce a tidy data text file (dataTidy.txt). The transformation steps are listed below and detailed in 'README.md'.


- User must manually set the working directory to the location of the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder.


__1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set__

- Location of test data, train data and working directory established.

- 'X_test.txt' and 'X_train.txt' are imported.

- X_train and X_test data is merged.

- dataX data frame is produced, with X_test and X_train merged (with 10,299 rows and 561 columns).
	
__2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement__

- Out of the 561 columns of measurements, only the measurements pertaining the mean and standard deviation are extracted. 

- The criteria for selecting mean and standard deviation measurements are names those 'features.txt' file names with substring 'mean()' and 'std()'.

- 'features.txt' is imported.

- features headers are applied to dataX.

- dataX is merged with features as columns names, X_train in the middle and X_text on the bottom.		

- Indexing merged data (dataX) with column numbers of measurements with mean or std, dataXf data frame is produced with 66 measurements (with 10,299 rows and 66 columns).

__3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set__

- 'subject_test.txt' and 'subject_train.txt' data is imported (contains row identifiers of the subject who performed the activity for test/train set).			

- subject_train and subject_test data is merged.

- 'y_test.txt' and 'y_train.txt' data is imported (activities).

- y_train and y_test data is merged.        

- subject data and y_train/y_test data is merged to the left of dataXf (merged X_test and X_train).		

- Each activity number (y_train, y_test) is subsetted and activity labels are applied as listed in 'activity_labels.txt' (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).

__4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names__

Please see above for details of descriptive variable names.

__5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject__

- reshape2 library is loaded for melt and cast functions.        

- melt function is used to reshape data to long-format, using subject and variable as id variables.        

- cast function is used to reshape data to wide-format, using subject and activity as id variables.          

- The tidy dataset is written to current working directory as 'dataTidy.txt'. 

- Dimensions of dataTidy are 180 rows and 68 columns. Each row indicates the subject identifier and activity label. Each column describes the signal measurement variables relating to either mean or standard deviation.         

- To open dataTidy.txt with Microsoft Excel, delimit with space.         

- 'dataTidy.txt' will be saved in the current working directory ('UCI HAR Dataset' folder).    

- To open dataTidy.txt with Excel, delimit with space.

- To upload dataTidy.txt into R, use read.table(yourPathHere) using the path to the location of 'dataTidy.txt'.
